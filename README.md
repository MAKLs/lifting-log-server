# MAKLs Lifting Log Server

MAKLs Lifting Log Server is the web server that hosts the RESTful API and web client for storing and consuming historical workout data.

As users enjoy their workouts, they log workout metadata and exercise data in a MAKLs Lifting Log client. Once finished, the users cam commit their workout data to the MAKLs Lifting Log Server, where the data will be historized for later consumption.
